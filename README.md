Several Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities exist in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron). These vulnerabilities could allow remote system compromise and potentially root privileges.

CVE-2011-4913 and CVE-2011-4914
These vulnerabilities are caused by a flaw in the X.25 Rose network protocol in the Linux kernel. A remote or local user could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges.

Solution
Upgrade to a version of Canonical Ubuntu Linux that is currently supported.
